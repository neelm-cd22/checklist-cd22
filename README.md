# Polycheck
Often, we have processes that we must follow in order to achieve a goal on time. As a result, checklists are generally the first choice to solve this problem. However, few applications are designed to record and track the progress and tasks of processes that consist of dozens of files, images, tasks, and subtasks. Polycheck is an advanced checklist application developed to help track various complicated and intricate protocols.
